Thismakes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reducedtoaconstantnumberofoperations, albeitatthecostofreducedeffectiveresolutiondue to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as describedinsection3.2.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, basedsolelyonattentionmechanisms,dispensingwithrecurrenceandconvolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to besuperiorinqualitywhilebeingmoreparallelizableandrequiringsignificantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles,byover2BLEU.OntheWMT2014English-to-Frenchtranslationtask, ourmodelestablishesanewsingle-modelstate-of-the-artBLEUscoreof41.8after trainingfor3.5daysoneightGPUs,asmallfractionofthetrainingcostsofthe bestmodelsfromtheliterature.

To reduce the memory footprint,\\nboth methods avoid storing the large attention matrix in the forward pass and recompute it in the backward\\npass.\\nThe ﬁrst major diﬀerence is that Rabe and Staats [66]focuses on the reducing the total memory footprint\\n(maximum amount of GPU memory required) while FlashAttention focuses on reducing memory accesses\\n(the number of memory reads/writes). As mentioned in Section 2, the amount of memory access is the\\nprimary determining factor of runtime. Reducing memory accesses also necessarily reduces the total amount', metadata={'page': 21, 'source': '/content/drive/My Drive/GenerativeAI/MateAI/rag_assignment/research_articles/Flash-attention.pdf'})]}"
